# Introduction

This is my Project & Portfolio IV project. We are given the opportunity to showcase all current skills gained from our Web Design and Development degree program at [Full Sail University](https://www.fullsail.edu/). 

We need to create a website of our choice (i.e. it can't be a portfolio site). We are to plan, design, build, and deploy a functional website.

# Website

I chose to create a website called Favoree, which is a business service. The sole-purpose of the business is to sell party favors for all types of occasion.

I actually do create party favors as a hobby of mines and have been approach about actually turning it into a business.

## Bootstrap

The bootstrap framework was utilized with a mix of customed CSS. SASS and Gulp was also used for the help of deployment. 


## Upcoming Focus

Better browser compatibility. I have yet to learn on how to perform this successfully. The ever challenging task. I hope to hone in on this in future courses.

## Website Link

Here is the link to the website: [Favoree](https://ephan077.github.io/Favoree/).
